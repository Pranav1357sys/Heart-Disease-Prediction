# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using Machine Learning techniques based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more. Early detection of heart disease can help in timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes.

The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. By applying supervised machine learning algorithms on structured healthcare data, this project aims to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

The main objectives are:

- Understand and analyze the dataset  
- Build a predictive ML model  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Demonstrate predictions
